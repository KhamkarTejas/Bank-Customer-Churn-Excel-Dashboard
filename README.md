# 🏦 Bank Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard 

## 📘 Project Overview

This project showcases an interactive **Bank Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard** built entirely in **Microsoft Excel**.
It provides a comprehensive view of customer retention and churn behavior across different demographic and financial factors.

The goal of this analysis is to identify **key drivers of customer churn** and provide actionable insights to improve customer retention strategies for a European Bank.

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

The dashboard is divided into two key sections:

**1️⃣ Demographic Behavior**

* **Churn by Gender:** Female customers have a higher churn rate (25.07%) compared to males (16.47%).

* **Churn by Geography:** Germany shows the highest churn rate (32.44%), suggesting a need for regional focus.

* **Churn by Age:** Older customers tend to churn more — age correlates positively with churn (r = 0.50).

* **Complaint Status:** Customers who raised complaints churn at a much higher rate.

* **Customer Activity:** Inactive users churn nearly twice as much as active users.

**2️⃣ Financial Insights**

* **Churn by Salary Group:** Middle- and high-salary customers show moderate churn, while very-high earners churn most.

* **Credit Score Relation:** Negative correlation (-0.45) between credit score and churn — lower credit scores link to higher churn.

* **Average Bank Balance:** Churned customers hold higher balances (€91K vs €72K), indicating high-value risk.

* **Product Holding:** Customers with 1–2 products churn more than multi-product customers.

* **Balance Group:** ‘Low’ and ‘High’ balance customers are more likely to leave than ‘Medium’ or ‘No Balance’ groups.
